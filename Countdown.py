n= input("give me a number") # ask the user for a number, the number that the user puts in is going to be the highest value.

while n>0 : # if the number is greater than 0, keep looping the code. 
    print n # print out the value of n,while it is being looped
    n=n-1 # subtract the value of n, so it will go down to 0.
